For this, after defeating any Pokemon, click the right mouse button on his body and use the \"Open\".\n\nA new window showing the loot rewards will be displayed, if there is a reward you will need to drag it to your backpack. These rewards are important for you to get money in the game, since they can be sold in Pokemart stores."},
